# advantages-of-type-annotations
A variety of projects and scenarios might benefit from a standard approach for representing type signatures for Python functions and methods. If you find yourself planning or implementing such a project, what conventions can you adopt that employ Python's existing features, reduce clutter in the source code, and allow Python programmers to leverage their existing skills?
