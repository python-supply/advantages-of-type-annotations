    "Suppose you are working on a project in Python that takes advantage of Python's support for higher-order functions. Perhaps you are allowing users to specify their own hooks or event handlers within a [web application framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), or you are creating a [unit testing library](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) that generates test cases for a user-supplied function. In many such use cases, you might find yourself dealing with two related scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* user-supplied functions can return results of different types and you do not know in advance what the result type of any given user-supplied function will be, or\n",
    "* your code needs to generate inputs to user-supplied functions that have the type the user-supplied function expects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these cases is more straightforward to handle at runtime: inspect the type of the output and branch accordingly. However, in the event that you need to determine this information in advance, you may not always be free to invoke the function (*e.g.*, if the function relies on some resource that is [not yet available](https://python.supply/iterators-generators-and-uncertainty/) or running the function has a very high cost). The second is more evidently difficult, and you would need to provide for the user a way to specify the input type. How can you organize your API to handle both of these issues in a way that keeps your API clean and allows users of your API to leverage features already built into Python?"

Starting with Python 3.5, the Python syntax was [extended](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) with mature and well-developed features that allow for *type annotations*: the ability to specify the types of variables and functions at the time they are defined. The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) calls these *type hints* because it is a purely syntactic feature. Type annotations are *not checked* statically (*i.e.*, at the time the code is parsed and transformed into bytecode) or dynamically (*i.e.*, when the code is actually running)."

    "Reviewing the [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) associated with the type annotation feature provides important context about how the Python community views this feature and its future evolution. In particular, it is [stated explicitly](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#non-goals) that it should not be inferred from the presence of this feature that Python will ever become a language that provides native support for type checking or requires type annotations. However, the community does envision the creation of user-built libraries for these purposes and views annotations as a standardized foundation."

    "Some third-party libraries leverage support for type annotations to provide [static type checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking) and even [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference). The [mypy library](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) can annotate Python code with type information automatically, can type-check a program statically (without running it), and can introduce run-time type checks. Other community members have written libraries that allow programmers to perform both static and run-time type checking simply by adding a decorator. One example is [enforce](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce), though the project appears to be dormant and is no longer compatible with the [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) library in the latest releases of Python."
